A script to log-in on stackoverflow so you can get that "Enthusiast" badge

how to use:
> install selenium and geckodriver (I used geckodriver version 26 and it goes well)

> put your user and password on the "user" and "password" variables respectively.

> Add this to a crontab if you want to run it on a server (That's the purpose)

In case of:
- Incorrect user
- Incorrect password
- captcha
- fire

nothing is going to work, bye.
